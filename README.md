# Min Relay

*Note: This client is developed by UNINETT AS and is tailor-made to suit higher education in Norway. 
It uses in-house developed APIs pertaining to a specific use-case and relies heavily on UNINETT Dataporten (for OAuth). 
Dependencies also require access to a self-hosted instance of TechSmith Relay.* 

Access to the client, regardless of user role, is enforced by Dataporten auth.

## Info 

Min Relay is a single-page web client that provides information views pertaining to an account holder's 
content. All information is drawn from Relay's own DB (read-only!), except:
 
 - Delete functionality, reads/writes to data source define by https://github.com/skrodal/techsmith-relay-presentation-delete
 - Hits, reads from data source generated by https://github.com/skrodal/relay-iis-logparser
